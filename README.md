A small program used for copying Windows Spotlight images to the user's Pictures folder for later use.

I love the photos that Windows Spotlight provides for the lock screen on Windows 10. So much so that I made this small, simple program which copies the files to the User's Pictures directory, renders them as .jpg and removes all of the non-spotlight images.
